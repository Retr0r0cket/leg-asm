# leg-asm

Leg-asm is an assembler for my version of the leg architecture from the game Turing Complete (for which I will make a github repository for). Customizable settings are constants in the start of leg_asm.py. opcodes.py can be run to verify the integrity of the opcodes.

I'll flesh this out more I promise!
